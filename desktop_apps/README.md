Put these either in `/usr/share/applications` to use them as standard Linux
applications **or** put them in `~/.config/autostart` or `/etc/xdg/autostart` for them to start on boot.

The latter accepts symbolic links as well (i.e., just have them in this
directory and `ln -s` them)

Globally for all users in /etc/xdg/autostart
